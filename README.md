# Weather App

A fun app that fetches a weather API. User can search for a city and some weather information will be the payload.

HTML, CSS, JS, REACT

<h3>Summary</h3>
I built this app because I wanted to use another type of API. I decided on a weather app because that's always useful. I built this in react and used async await to fetch the data. I had fun with this small app because I can now know the weather around the world.
